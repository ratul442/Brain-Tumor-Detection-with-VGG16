# Project Description

A brain tumor occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: cancerous (malignant) tumors and benign tumors. Malignant tumors can be divided into primary tumors, which start within the brain, and secondary tumors, which have spread from elsewhere, known as brain metastasis tumors.

Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, particularly Deep learning, have shown remarkable progress in image-recognition jobs. Practices ranging from convolutional neural networks(CNN) to variational autoencoders have found innumerable applications in the medical image analysis field, driving it forward at a rapid pace. In radiology, trained physicians visually evaluated medical images for the detection, characterization, and monitoring of diseases. AI algorithms outshine at automatically recognizing complex patterns in imaging data and producing quantitative, rather than qualitative, evaluations of radiographic features.
